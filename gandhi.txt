      <h2>About Mahatma Gandhi</h2>
      <p>Mahatma Gandhi, also known as Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was born on October 2, 1869. He was a leader of India’s non-violent independence movement against British rule. With the principle of <strong>Ahimsa</strong> (non-violence) and civil disobedience, he inspired millions and changed the world’s view on political activism.</p>
      <p>He studied law in London and later worked in South Africa, where he experienced racial injustice. Returning to India, he led several national movements like the Salt March and Quit India Movement. His approach was grounded in peace, simplicity, and truth.</p>
